* Introduction
Simple repository containing examples of using cython to improve perf.
I used these examples to ramp-up on cython. Thus it could hopefully serve as a
good companion for others along the same process.

* Pre-reqs
1. python
2. cython
3. setuptools
4. make
5. build-essential

* Usage
Just use 'make' in the root of this repo to build and run the samples. Open the
respective directories to know the code and its usage. In order to know all
 targets currently available, just type 'make' in the commandline.

* Disclaimer!
Many example codes are shamelessly copied (and a bit modified) from cython's
official page here: http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/external.html
